In a similar vein as The Zen of Python, it might be useful to set some guidelines.

## The Great Guidelines
1. Good error messages are more important than anythying else.
    - *The Erroneous Corollary*: Therefore error handling should be a cornerstone of design, not an afterthought.
2. Modules are a great idea. Everything should be modular.
3. Distributed revision control systems are a great idea. It should be a given.
4. Semantic versioning is a great idea. We can use that.
5. The Internet is a great idea. We could utilize that more.
    - *The Internet Corollary*: Never write synchronous blocking code.
6. The distinction between interpretted languages and compiled languages is a historical relic. We can do both.
7. ...more as I think of them.
