#### What is "Voil√°!"?

## A new programming language

But hopefully a language that will redefine what it means to be "programming language".
Syntax and semantics don't really make or break a language.
I want to develop more of an integrated programming ecosystem.
Something practical, focussed around solving everyday programming frustrations.
But also something beautiful that introduces the 'hoi polloi' to some of the powerful ideas that have come out of academia.

I don't plan on writing the language right away.
Rather I plan to make a series of libraries for use with existing languages, to experiment with different ideas first.
